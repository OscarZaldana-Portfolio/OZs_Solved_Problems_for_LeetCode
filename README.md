# OZs_Solved_Problems_for_LeetCode
Hello and welcome to my repository for Leetcode questions. This is a repository for Leetcode like questions and at some point there will be questions from many different sites but for now ill start with leetcode. This is being built mainly for myself but also for any companies that will like to view my work. I will be attempting to create a UI system that will allow people to go over the different questions in a easier to view and educational procedure but it may take some time. This will be the main repository of work but each question will be answered in multiple languages and those languages will probably be split into different folders. Also, for each question I will try to split it into two parts. One way that makes use of speed and another that makes use of storage.
